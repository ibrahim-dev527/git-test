# Frontend Mentor Challenges

Welcome to my Frontend Mentor challenge submissions! 🎉  
I recently joined **Frontend Mentor** to sharpen my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills by building real-world projects. Each challenge helps me grow as a developer and pushes me to write cleaner, more responsive, and more accessible code.

## 🚀 What You Will Find Here
This repository contains:

- Completed Frontend Mentor challenges  
- My code solutions (HTML, CSS, JS)  
- Project screenshots and live previews  
- Notes on what I learned from each challenge  

## 🎯 Goals
- Improve my front-end development skills  
- Build real, user-friendly interfaces  
- Practice responsive design  
- Write clean, maintainable code  
- Prepare for real-world web development jobs  

## 📂 Projects
I will keep adding challenge folders as I complete them.  
Each project includes:
- `/index.html`
- `/style.css`
- `/script.js` (if needed)
- A dedicated README explaining the challenge

 🤝 Feedback
I’m always open to feedback or suggestions.  
If you see ways I can improve, feel free to open an issue or message me.
